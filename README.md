# UOCollection

UOCollection offers the developer a range of tools to make it as easy as possible to create software related to Ultima Online. This repository lives from the community and is also supported by it. This means that functionalities are gradually being added. Built into different components, which have a meaningful separation, the developer can add these to his project as required. The focus should also be on documentation and create transparency.

### FileHandling 
Offers basic components for processing the file types "mul" and "uop" known in Ultima Online. This creates the opportunity to read them and process them at the same time. Reference: https://github.com/UO-Collection/UOCollection/tree/main/UOCollection.FileHandling
